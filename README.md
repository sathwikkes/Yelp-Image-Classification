# Yelp-Image-Classification  
  
This is my **Third Capstone Project** for Springobard DSC.  
  
  
I. Context  
Are you a foodie? Do you ever find yourself taking a picture of your meal before completely devouring it just because it was either well-presented (garnished perfectly) or super delicious, you wanted to save the moment? With smart phones being the norm and social media applications such as Instagram and Snapchat blowing up, everyday more and more photos of food are popping up/being uploaded along with reviews. A popular platform that helps users decide which businesses to choose from, especially when it comes to food, is Yelp.  
  
ex: people posting videos of cutting their egg, satisfying yolk   
  	
II. Motivation   
One of the worst situations a customer deals with is receiving the wrong order. It has happened to me many times and being a vegetarian in a meat eating nation, I’ve been given the wrong food several times.  
  
III. Problem Identification  
Wouldn’t life be much easier if there was a way to identify what is in my food, something like simply taking a picture? Image. Recognition. Although image captioning is a work in progress, out of my interest/passion for computer vision, I will be developing a yelp image classifier to gain a basic understanding of Neural Networks/Convolutional Neural Networks.    
  
IV. Data Source  
Yelp has a huge database of pictures and it can be found here ![(link to dataset)](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)   
  
Below are some example images from the dataset

V. Criteria for Success  
* Understanding the Foundations of Neural Networks   
* Loading & Preprocessing the data  
* Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network  
* Model Improvement  
* Metrics  
  
VI. Constraints  
1. Project   
* Images weren’t in an organized fashion (one folder with 200,000 photos)  
* Loading in the Images for train/test sets    
* Varying Image sizes

* Building the Architecture (correct parameters)  
2. My Shortcomings     
* CPU/GPU Capacity     
I used Google Colab Pro for this project.
